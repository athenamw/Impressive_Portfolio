            My name is Athena Wallis. I have recently completed a full stack web developer bootcamp through UC Berkeley. I am excited to use my new skills to help to build and maintain websites. Not only do I have the technical skills I have learned, but I also have soft skills from my many years of customer service and managerial experience.
